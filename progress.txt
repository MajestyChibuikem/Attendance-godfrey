using a web based app directly is basically not possible always
some mobile apps dont give the correct mac address
so i cant get the correct mac which means the attendance cant be taken

the first method tried worked (technically) but the mac address for two
different devices were the same which fails the requirement for each device
to have the mac as a unique identifier

the next choice for me is to create it as a mobile application
my wifi router can 90% of times accurately get the device mac address
this seems to come from the fact routers work on the basic network level
but my web app works on a higher level making it unable to accurately get the addresses


i have chosen instead to go the app route

frontend

each app downloaded will generate a unique device id when the app is first downloaded
the id will be sent to the backend after user registration
id will be binded to the user account and the key wil be stored securely
backend

i will store the id and key in a database along the users details
when the mobile app sends attendance data, the key and id will be validated
the attendance will be recorded if (dataisvalid)


key cloning and sharing
the key will be paired with the hardware based cryptographic capabilities
-using KeyPair(Android keystore, ios secure enclave)


tokens
JWT


Secure hardware identifiers
i will use system APIs to retrieve user hardware-specific identifiers
Android - Settings.Secure.Android
Ios - identifierForVendor

i will also ensure api requests are made https
se token based authentication for secure communication between the app and backend
